          <p className="mt-3">
            At our Hostel Food Surplus Management System, we aim to bridge the gap between food waste and affordable dining. We believe that food should never go to waste when there are hungry students who need it. By connecting surplus food with students, we not only save food but also provide budget-friendly meal options for hostel residents.
